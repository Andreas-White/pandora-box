Concepts:
- Decoupling of sender and receiver
- Receiver contains reference to next receiver
- Promotes loose coupling
- May not have a handler

Examples:
- Logger api
- javax.servlet.Filter
- Spring Security Filter Chain

Design:
- Chain of receiver objects
- Handler is Interface based
- ConcreteHandler for each implementation
- Each Handler has a reference to the next
- Uml Diagram: Handler (interface), ConcreteHandler

Pitfalls:
- Handling/Handler guarantee
- Runtime configuration risk
- Chain length/performance issues
- Memory leak
