Concepts:

- Only one instance is created
- Guarantee control of a resource
- Lazily loaded

Examples from java lib:
    - Runtime
    - Logger
    - Spring Beans

Design:
- Class is responsible for lifecycle
- Static in nature
- Needs to be thread safe
- Private instance of the class
- Private constructor
- No param for constructor

Pitfalls:
- often overused
- difficult to test
- if not careful can be not thread-safe
- Sometimes confused with factory
- Confused with Prototype
