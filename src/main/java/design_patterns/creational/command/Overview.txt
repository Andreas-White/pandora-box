Concepts:
- Encapsulates each request as an Object
- Object oriented callback
- Decouple sender from processor
- Often used for "undo" functionality

Examples:
- Runnable
- javax.swing.Action

Design:
- Object per command / breaks concept of OOP
- Command Interface
- Execute method
- "Undo" method
- Uses Reflection
- Command (interface), Invoker , ConcreteCommand

Pitfalls:
- Dependence on other patterns
- Multiple commands
- Make use of Memento pattern
- Prototype pattern for copies
